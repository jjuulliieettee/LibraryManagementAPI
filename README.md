# **LibraryManagementApi**

A simple administrative tool for a book library using JWT, notifications about adding/removing/ordering a book using SignalR, CRUD operations with books, authors, genres, orders are implemented with the help of ASP.NET Core Web API.

You can view endpoints via *Swagger*.

You must specify a valid auth token for each request, which returns 401, in Authorization tab, type - Bearer token if Postman is used.

***Note:*** some endpoints are accessible only for users with a specific role (*Reader/Librarian*).

## **Basic project description**
There are 5 main entities: ***Books, Authors, Genres, Orders, Users***, who are assigned a role of a *Reader and Librarian*.

A *Reader* can book a book for a specified date and it becomes unavailable.

A *Librarian* can confirm the order (when the reader takes the book from the library). Then the book becomes borrowed.

The *Librarian* closes the order when the Reader returns the book. The book becomes available again.

***Note:***

* When the book is unavailable, it cannot be modified, deleted, booked by somebody else.

* The availability book status is a book property, the borrow book status is an order property.

#### **If you wish to use the app, follow these steps:**

1. Clone this repo.

2. Run **Update-Database** in Package Manager Console. 
***Note:*** Database will be seeded with users, books (with authors and genres) when you run the app for the first time. 

#### **The app consists of the following modules:**

## **Authorization**

1. To log in use **Auth/Login** endpoint. *You will need to be logged in to use all endpoints regarding books (and the related entities â€“ authors, genres) and orders unless stated otherwise.*

## **Books (CRUD)**
1. To view list of all books with the ability to *filter, sort, and group by author, genre, year*, use **Books/Get all** endpoint. To view only *available* books, specify the respective parameter. You do not have to be authorized for this.
2. To view one book at a time, use **Books/Get** endpoint. You do not have to be authorized for this.
3. To add a new book, use **Books/Post** endpoint. You have to be authorized as *librarian*. You receive a *real-time notification* about this action.
4. To update an existing book, use **Books/Put** endpoint. You have to be authorized as *librarian*.
5. To delete an existing book, use **Books/Delete** endpoint. You have to be authorized as *librarian*. You receive a *real-time notification* about this action.

***Note:*** you cannot edit or delete a book if it is booked.

5. To delete an existing genre, use **Genres/Delete** endpoint. 

***Note:*** you cannot edit or delete a genre if there are books related to it.

## **Orders (CRUD)**
1. To view list of all orders with the ability to *filter, sort, and group by reader and librarian*, use **Orders/Get all** endpoint. To view only *borrowed* books, specify the respective parameter.
